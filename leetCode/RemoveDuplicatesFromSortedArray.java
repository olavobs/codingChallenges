//Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique
//element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
//
//Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique
//elements k.
//
//The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index
//k - 1 can be ignored.

//Input: nums = [1,1,2]
//Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
//Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
//It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

//Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
//Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
//Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
//It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
